# Housing Price Prediction

----
## Installations Required
*	Miniconda â€“ x64 version for Windows - https://conda.io/miniconda.html
*	Visual Studio Code on Windows (IDE) - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows

----
## Setup:

* After installing miniconda, run the following commands in Anaconda Prompt from the project folder path. 

    These are used to create and activate a conda environment where we will be running the prediction model for price analysis. 

	> conda create -n HousePricing
	> conda activate HousePricing


* We are also installing Jupyter notebooks as these allow us to have both analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) with executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis. To install jupyter notebooks, we need:

	> conda install jupyter
	> conda install nb_conda



* We will also require the following packages. NumPy and Pandas are used for Data Manipulation and Analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for generating visualizations and plots. 

	> conda install numpy
	> conda install pandas
	> conda install matplotlib
	> conda install seaborn
